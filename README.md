which you will need to bypass, otherwise your game will end immediately.

In addition to this, the game has a leaderboard that remembers the last 5 best scores with the names of the players. The table data is stored in a separate folder and is obtained using the Pickle module.

The game is written using the Piglet module, and the interface is made up of bitmaps created in photoshop.  
Thank you for your timeðŸ˜‹  
  
Well, if you have another minute, you can help me in my development and tell me how to assemble my something into one exe file. I tried to do this through pyinstaller, but nothing worked, when I start, an error is returned that a particular file was not found.  
I will be very glad :)
  
## For Executable:
In the The-Snake folder:
* `pyinstaller --onefile .\main.py`
* `cp .\dist\main.exe .`
* `.\main.exe`

The fonts and images need to be in the same directory as that of executable.
