# The-snake
A year ago, I entered college with a degree in information systems and programming. Half a year ago I decided to start learning python on my own and I wanted to create my first project for learning by doing. I would like to hear adequate criticism, preferably with links to resources where I can pull up this or that topic.
As I said, the first project was to make a snake game in python using the pyglet library. Everything was created completely from scratch, the language and the library were studied in parallel. The first experience with classes was used. The application has a main menu, a leaderboard and the game itself, where a snake crawls and eats apples. Every 5 points, stones appear on the field, creating additional complexity. I tried to comment the code, but I'm not sure that it's very good, I hope you figure it out. Please be understanding.
Thanks!:)
